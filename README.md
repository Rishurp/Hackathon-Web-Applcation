# Hackathon Web Application

This project is a simple hackathon management dashboard for organizers. The web app allows organizers to create, edit, and delete hackathons and manage their details. Organizers can also sort, search, and filter hackathons based on different criteria such as level, status, and date. The app provides a responsive UI for managing hackathons with various features.

## Features

- **Create Hackathon**: Organizers can create new hackathons with fields such as name, description, image, level (easy, medium, hard), start date, and end date.
- **Edit & Delete Hackathons**: Hackathons can be edited or deleted after creation.
- **Sort Hackathons**: Sort hackathons by newest first or oldest first.
- **Filter Hackathons**: Filter hackathons by level (easy, medium, hard) or status (active, upcoming, past).
- **Search Hackathons**: Search hackathons by name.
- **Timers**:
  - Active hackathons show a countdown to their end.
  - Upcoming hackathons show a countdown to their start.
  - Past hackathons display both start and end dates.
- **Hackathon Details Page**: When a hackathon card is clicked, it navigates to a page showing full details of the hackathon with options to edit or delete.
